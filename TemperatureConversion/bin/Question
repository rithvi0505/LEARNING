Scenario: Bob is working on a weather app that needs to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. He's aware of the conversion formulas but needs to write methods to perform the conversions accurately.

Task: Bob needs your assistance in creating a Java program to handle temperature conversions. He has provided you with the conversion formulas and wants you to guide him through the process of building the necessary methods and user interface.

Scenario Details

- The temperature conversion formulas are as follows:

- Celsius to Fahrenheit: `(C × 9/5) + 32`

- Fahrenheit to Celsius: `(F - 32) × 5/9`

where `C` represents the temperature in Celsius and `F` represents the temperature in Fahrenheit.
